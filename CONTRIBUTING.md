## Adding to This List

Please ensure your [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search open and closed PRs to avoid duplicate suggestions.
- Only submit design patterns that you think would be useful to others. This implies each pattern has enough succinct content to describe why it's useful.
- Design patterns are listed alphabetically within each category of the [README](README.md) document.
- Use title-case, e.g. "Factory Method", "Chain of Responsibility".
- Code formatting should follow standard [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) default settings, including:
  - Indent with two spaces
  - Use double quotes
  - **Avoid letting your code formatter format other section of the README file.**
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- The PR should have a useful title, e.g., "Add [PATTERN NAME] pattern".

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating Your Pull Request

Sometimes a maintainer will ask you to edit your pull request before it's included. This is normally due to merge conflicts, spelling errors, or because your PR didn't match the above guidelines. [This write-up](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) covers the different ways you can change a pull request.
